each "team" will give me a URL to hit with a script (or GUI, if i have time) of the format:

http://[your url]ffffff where color is an RGB color in hex format (FFFFFF = WHITE) and your job is to return one of the following colors : 
pink
red
orange
yellow
green
blue
violet
black
brown
grey
white 
i will simply append the color to the URL your provide. so you can have it be anything. I will simply call your URL+currentColor and expect a string in response. Not JSON, just text
